# MobileSite
This project is a desktop and mobile site with Home, About and Services page for a business with ability to submit Contact Us information. I have used jquery and HTML to code this.
This is my learning project with "Projects in jQuery Mobile:Learn by building Real World Apps" course at Udemy
